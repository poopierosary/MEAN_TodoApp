# MEAN_TodoApp
A MEAN stack simple todo application with Angular 2 while using skeleton.

## Tasks List:
- [ ] Get it working with MEAN stack (it should already work, stupid.)
- [ ] Possibly convert all js files to typescript to keep it align with typescript.
- [ ] Implement the skeleton structure (maybe do this as a secondary github repo).
